      <p>In an effort to create music visualizations that are sensitive to the qualities of the harmony being played, 
        I tried to algorithmically classify sets of notes based on their harmonic qualities.</p>
      <p>The above paper details my approach, which involves interpreting the notes with every possible root, 
        and then scoring each interpretation based on the presence or absence of certain intervals, the importance 
        of which is specified in the parameters of the interpreter.</p>

      <p>I have already implemented a Processing sketch which takes MIDI input 
        from a keyboard and displays all twelve interpretations, which can be 
        found <a href="https://github.com/thomascastleman/midi-harmony-interpreter" target="_blank">here</a>. 
        I plan to use this technology to design visualizations that respond to the 
        intricacies of the harmony being played.</p>
